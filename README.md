# Next.js Application Boilderplate with Shadcn/ui components

This project is a Next.js application bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. It leverages a variety of modern web development tools and libraries to create a scalable and maintainable application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server, you can use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
